## Introduction
For this project, I use  `React` for the front-end framework with `Material-UI` for UI part. 

For database I use Mysql as required with `Sequelize` as ORM and  `sequelize-cli` to create and migrate database. As required for ActiveRecord, `Sequelize` will be 
a perfect alternative (http://ossterdam.com/2016/05/16/sequelize-activerecord-for-nodejs-orm/)

In terms of Deployment I use `docker-compose`  for backend in `currency-conversion-api` folder, please find the further instruction in
 `currency-conversion-api/README.md` and `currency-conversion/README.md`
